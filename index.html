            <h1>Daniel Ho</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">Backend junior developer</p>
            <p>After finishing my degree in Environmental Management, I didn't feel like this was 
            the right career path for me as I have always been drawn to IT industry and the 
            idea of working from anywhere I want was really appealing to me.</p>
            <p>Thanks to Green Fox Academy I was able to become backend developer after just four 
            and a half months. As someone who enjoys solving problems and puzzles, I can't wait
            to get into the tech industry and see what it has in stores for me!
